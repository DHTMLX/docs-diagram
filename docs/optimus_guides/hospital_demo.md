## Demo overview

The Hospital Management System demo is a complex solution to show you the way how DHTMLX widgets can be organized and what components they have on board. You can use the demo to build your management system easily.

Pay attention to how the Patient Registration Form is realized. Here you can find built-in Datepicker, Combobox,  Input fields, RadioGroup controls, and even more.

Treegrid is the main widget of the demo. With a help of it, you can manage the hospital in real-time. Tabbar helps you to organize the information in the Treegrid in a convenient way.

DHTMLX diagram is one more feature of the demo. It helps to visualize a hospital management hierarchy.

We used the DHTMLX Optimus framework to create The Hospital Management System demo. The components of the demo are divided into Views. You can initialize or modify each component separately. Any component can be removed. The demo can be taken as a View itself and become a component of another app.

There are no specific backend requirements. The demo is based on the REST API and you can use any backend platform which supports it (PHP, Nodejs, .Net, Java, etc.).
