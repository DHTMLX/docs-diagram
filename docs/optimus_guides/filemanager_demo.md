## Demo overview

The File Manager demo is a very usable solution to work with files of any size. You can easily integrate the demo with your project and modify it for your purposes.

We used the DHTMLX Optimus framework to create the File manager demo. The components of the demo are divided into Views. You can initialize or modify each component separately. Any component can be removed. The demo can be taken as a View itself and become a component of another app.

There are no specific backend requirements. The demo is based on the REST API and you can use any backend platform which supports it (PHP, Nodejs, .Net, Java, etc.).
