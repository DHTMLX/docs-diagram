## How to start

Follow the instruction in the README.md file to run the demo. Enjoy a nice and easy to modify solution build on the DHTMLX Optimus framework.

## Demo overview

DHTMLX Chart from the Suite package is the core component of the demo. It provides various types of charts for visualizing complex data. The KPI tracking system is an interactive demo. You can change the parameters and see the results immediately.

The KPI demo is built with the help of the DHTMLX Optimus framework. The components of the demo are divided into Views. You can initialize or modify each component separately. Any component can be removed. The demo can be taken as a View itself and become a component of another app.

The solution you can see has no requirements for the backend. It is based on the REST API and you can use any backend platform which supports it (PHP, Nodejs, .Net, Java, etc.).
