## Demo overview

One of the main components of the project is Grid. You can add multiline headers and footers, set frozen columns, apply column editors such as a checkbox or combobox, and much more. Please check all the possibilities â€“ the demo is interactive. Pay attention to all widgets in it.

Layout, Grid, List, Toolbar, Sidebar, and Calendar are integrated with the help of the DHTMLX Optimus framework. The solution has no requirements for the backend. It is based on the REST API and you can use any backend platform which supports it (PHP, Nodejs, .Net, Java, etc.).
