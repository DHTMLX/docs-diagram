The Container control is a very convenient way to develop Form-based solutions. You can improve your project with HTML code or combine several native widgets in one Form to make the project functional and easy to use.

Pay attention: you cannot attach the Layout and Form widgets.

## How to start

You can add the Container control to the Form in an easy way. All you need is to specify the type of the control `type: "container"` during the initialization of a Form and then use one of the methods: 
- [attach](form/api/container/container_attach_method.md)
- [attachHTML](form/api/container/container_attachHTML_method.md)

You can also attach the HTML code directly to the Container control. See the sample above.

## Methods

You can manipulate the Container control by using methods of the object returned by the [getItem](form/api/form_getitem_method.md) method. Use methods to hide or show the Container, set and get properties, and so on.
