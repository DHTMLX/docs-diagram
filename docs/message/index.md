---          

dhtmlxMessage is a tiny but useful component that helps you to interact with a user of your application. Depending on the type of a message, you can inform a user about some processes taking place in the app, ask for confirmation of some action, warn against some steps that may result in unwanted effects, or simply give a hint about the purpose of a certain element of an app.
