@params:
- new_item		object		the object of a new item 

@example:

diagram.paint();

@template:	api_method
@descr:


There are two ways to link shapes, you can add a shape with a parent ID defined:

~~~js
diagram.addItem({ id: "3.2", text: "New Item", type: "card", parent: "3" });
~~~

or you can add a shape and a connector:

~~~js
diagram.addItem({ type: "card", id: "3.2", text: "New Item" });
diagram.addItem({ type: "line",  from: "3", to: "3.2" });
~~~

{{note Adding a shape doesn't result in an automatic repaint, you need to add the *paint()* command to update the visual state of the widget}}


#### Data properties

- **id** - optional, the id of a shape, autogenerated by default
- **type** - optional, the type of a shape, "card" by default

The data object can contain any other custom properties. Such custom properties can be retrieved through API or used inside of templates.


#### Type

"type" in the above code is a type of shape, it is one of the predefined values:

- *card*
