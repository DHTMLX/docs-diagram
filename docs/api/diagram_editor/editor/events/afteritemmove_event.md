# afterItemMove

### Description

@short: Fires when an item is moved one grid step

:::note
The event doesn't work with the **line** object.

The event fires just for the target element despite the number of selected elements. The ids of dragged elements are provided in the `batch` parameter of the callback function.
:::

### Usage

~~~jsx
"afterItemMove": ({
    id: string | number, 
    batch: (string | number)[],
    coords: object,
    event: PointerEvent
}) => void;
~~~

### Parameters

The callback of the event is called with an object with the following parameters:

- `id` - the id of an item
- `batch` - an array of moved elements' ids
- `coords` - an object with the `x` and `y` coordinates of the item position after movement, where:
    - `x` - the horizontal position of the item, moving from left to right
    - `y` - the vertical position of the item, moving from top to bottom
- `event` - an event object

:::info
For handling the inner Diagram Editor events you can use the **on()** method.
:::

### Example

~~~jsx {6-13}
// initializing Diagram Editor
const editor = new dhx.DiagramEditor("editor_container");
// loading data
editor.parse(data);

// attaching a handler to the event
editor.events.on("afterItemMove", ({ id, coords }) => {
    console.log(`
        Item ${id} is at the position: 
            x: ${coords.x} 
            y: ${coords.y}
    `);
});
~~~

**Change log**:

- The `batch` parameter was added in the v6.0
- The callback function takes an object as a parameter since v6.0
